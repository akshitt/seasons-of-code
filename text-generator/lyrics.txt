When you said we couldn't do it again  
'Cause you had a thing with some other man  
  
You said it was love  
And you said you were lost  
Then you wished me good luck  
To find somebody to love  
But, ooh

And oh  
I'll give you something to live for  
Yes, I will

When he stared into your eyes  
And he just might be too good for you  
You're almost dead to him  
You're sleeping with a frozen heart  
Well baby girl it's over now  
And you can always count on me  
Your uncheckable,

And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb  
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come  
All the misery was necessary when we're deep in love  
This I know, girl, I know  
  
[Bridge]  
She told me, "Don't worry about it"  
She told me, "Don't worry no more"  
We both know we can't go without it  
She told me you'll never be in love, oh, oh, woo

I can't feel my face when I'm with you  
But I love it, but I love it, oh

All alone she was living  
In a world without an end or beginning  
Babygirl was living life for the feeling  
But I don't mind, I don't mind  
And all the wrongs she committed  
She was numb and she was so co-dependent  
She was young and all she had was the city  
But I don't mind, I don't mind  
  
[Bridge]  
And I know that she's capable of anything, it's riveting  
But when you wake up she's always gone, gone, gone  
  
[Hook]  

She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)

He sang a song when he did it  
He was cold and he was so unforgiving  
Now she dances to the song on the minute  
Yeah, all the time, all the time  
It make her weak when she hear it  
And it got her on her knees like religion  
She was young and she was forced to be a woman  
Yeah, all the time, all the time  
  
[Bridge]  
And I know that she's capable of anything, it's riveting  
But when you wake up she's always gone, gone, gone  
  

Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face  
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)  
  
I don't think you understand...

Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face  
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)

I usually love sleeping all alone  
This time around bring your friend with you  
But we ain't really going to sleep at all  
You ain't gonna catch me with them sneak pictures

That pussy kill be so vicious  
My god why she in my pockets  
Get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous

That girl been drinkin' all day, need to change bladder  
She's just happy that the crew's back in town  
She's 'bout to go downtown for a whole hour  
If I had her, you can have her, man it don't matter  
I'm never sour, I'm just smokin' somethin' much louder

Imma spend it all on bitches  
And everybody fuckin', everybody fuckin'  
Pussy on the house, everybody fuckin'  
Man, I miss my city, man, it's been a minute  
MIA a habit, Cali was the mission

And I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke  
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless  
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans  
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix  
Now we get faded when we want, girl, we got choices  
Lay them on the fuckin' table, we got choices  
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices  
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless

I know everything

I love her, today  
'Cause it's Wednesday, I won't be late  
Now I need to know if you're feeling when I'm free  
  
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday  
Sunday but on Thursday, Thursday  
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday  
Sunday but on Thursday, make sure you are thirsty  
Oh on Thursday, baby get ready oh on Thursday  
Whoa you hold it oh on Thursday, just wait on Thursday,  
Baby only Thursday  
  
Can I try, can I try?  
I've been here for too long  
Baby don't cry  
When are you calling again, oh again  
But it's not Thursday, baby why you calling?  
  
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday  
Sunday but on Thursday, Thursday  
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday  
Sunday but on Thursday, make sure you are thirsty  
Oh on Thursday, baby get ready oh on Thursday  
Whoa you hold it oh on Thursday, just wait on Thursday,  
Baby only Thursday  
  
Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, Thursday

There comes a time in a man's life  
He must take responsibility  
For the choices he has made  
There are certain things that he must do  
Things that he must say  
  
Like I Love you  
And I need you  
I only want you  
And nobody's goin' to know if it's true  
  
I never thought I'd feel this kind of hesitation (tonight)  
My hand on another girl  
I wish I didn't have to lie  
I wish I could let you know  
  
'Cause I love you  
And I need you  
I only want you  
And nobody's going to know if it's true  
  
Valerie  
I know you can see through me  
Valerie  
You just choose to never know  
Valerie  
Why pretend to trust in me?  
(I don't know why you try to trust in me baby, but I think I might know )  
Valerie  
You'd rather this than be alone  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)  
  
'Cause I love you  
And I need you  
I only want you  
And nobody's going to know if it's true  
  
'Cause I love you  
And I need you  
I only want you  
And nobody's going to know if it's true  
  
And I love you  
And I need you  
I only want you  
And nobody gonna know

And he don't gotta know, I got you on the floor  
Doing things you never thought you'd do  
Baby leave them high heel shoes

I'm lookin' up at you  
And I don't give a damn shorty, watch me knock them boots off
