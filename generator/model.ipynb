on turf, Kyu  \\n  \\n[Chorus: x2]  \\n  \\nI\\'m going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps  \\nEveryday in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheep  \\nPraying for sleep  \\nDreaming with a watering mouth  \\n  \\nWishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse  \\nIn this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts  \\nWith the root of all evil  \\nI\\'ve seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful  \\n  \\nAnd make them do shit illegal  \\nFor these Grant\\'s and Jackson\\'s  \\nThese transactions explain a man\\'s actions  \\nBut in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity  \\n  \\nThrough God and there\\'s a wish he granted me  \\nHe showed me how to cope with the stress  \\nAnd hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed  \\nAlways groping a mess, of flying over the nest  \\n  \\nTo selling dope with the rest  \\nI quit smoking cess to open my chest  \\nLife is stressful inside this cesspool  \\nTrying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel  \\n  \\nMy little brother\\'s trying to learn his mathematics  \\nHe\\'s asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts  \\nKids attract static, children with automatics  \\nTaking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets  \\n  \\nI\\'m using smarter tactics to overcome this slum  \\nI won\\'t become as dumb as some and succumb to scum  \\nIt\\'s cumbersome, I\\'m trying to do well on this Earth  \\nBut it\\'s been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth  \\n  \\n[Chorus: x2]  \\n  \\nUh, it\\'s OK, yeah it\\'s alright, even though I can\\'t sleep  \\nUh yeah, it\\'s OK,
